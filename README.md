# MOViEon app


The MOViEon is a movie app similar to streaming apps like Netflix and SkyShowTime, it downloads data about films and series from  <a href="https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noopener"> TheMovieDb API </a>

It is currently under construction 💪

So My list (a database storing a list of favorite films) is working fine and search engine for movies too.

Now I'm working on adding a modal showing details of a given film and maybe I would also add a link to the movies trailers on YouTube 😁

🙋 so stay tuned for newest improvements.
