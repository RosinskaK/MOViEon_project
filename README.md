# MOViEon app


The MOViEon is a movie app similar to streaming apps like Netflix and SkyShowTime, it downloads data about films and series from  <a href="https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noopener"> TheMovieDb API </a>

It is currently under construction üí™

I'm working on adding a search engine for movies and series and a database storing a list of favorites‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è

üôã so stay tuned for newest improvements.
